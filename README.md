## 🎮 Gameplay

Pilot a small spacecraft through the depths of space, where danger is everywhere.  
A single mistake can send you crashing into an asteroid, leaving nothing but wreckage behind.

In the vast emptiness of the universe, there is **no gravity to slow you down**. Every force you apply persists until you counter it.  
Fuel is limited, and careless maneuvers may leave you drifting helplessly through space. **Mastering momentum and energy is the key to survival.**

As you travel forward, you will cross galaxy after galaxy, each filled with new challenges.  
Hidden within asteroid fields are astronauts lost during critical missions, **rescue all of them before advancing to the next galaxy**.
